## 📝 Summary & Core Concepts

Linux is an open-source operating system known for its flexibility and wide range of distributions. Inspired by Unix, it relies on a powerful kernel to manage resources and offers a command-line interface (Shell) for precise control.  
Linux follows the philosophy that "everything is a file" and uses a hierarchical filesystem structure starting from the root `/`.

### 📑 Key Concepts

* **Kernel:** The core component responsible for managing hardware and system resources.
* **Shell:** The command-line interface that allows users to interact with the system.
* **Filesystem Hierarchy:** The structured organization of files and directories starting from `/`.
* **Bootloader:** The program responsible for initiating the system startup.
* **Daemons:** Background services that run without direct user interaction.

**Description:** Shows the system version and kernel details.

```bash
$ uname -a
```

### 2. Explore Filesystem Structure

**Description:** Lists and visualizes top-level directories.

```bash
$ ls /
$ tree -L 1 /
```

### 3. View Active Processes and Services

**Description:** Displays running processes and background services.

```bash
$ top
$ ps aux
```
